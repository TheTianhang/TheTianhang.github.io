**Comments**

Force field is the **soul** of simulation. It describes the relationships and connections between simulated particles.

    In the real life, we have many relationships. In the simulated world, each particle also has relationships with other particles.

For example, there are 100 A type beads and 100 B type beads. Interactions can occur between A and B, A and A, B and B type beads. 

**Specific example**

We define nonbonded interactions between A and A, B and B in A.lt and B.lt, and define interactions between A and B in AB.lt.
